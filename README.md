# Air-Quality-Data-Analytics


## Project Overview
The Air Quality Data Analytics project aims to analyze and visualize air quality data to gain insights into pollutant levels across various regions. By employing statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, the project seeks to highlight trends and variations in air quality metrics, providing valuable information for environmental monitoring and public health awareness.

## Objectives
- To clean and preprocess air quality data for accurate analysis.
- To construct pivot tables for efficient organization of pollutant metrics based on geographic locations.
- To perform statistical analyses, including T-tests and ANOVA, to compare pollutant levels across different states.
- To visualize findings through graphs and charts for better interpretation of data trends.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was examined to identify and remove constant columns, ensuring that only relevant information was retained.
- **Pivot Table Creation**: Constructed pivot tables to summarize pollutant metrics such as minimum, maximum, and average values by state, city, and station.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Implemented T-tests to compare air quality between states and ANOVA to assess the variance across multiple regions, validating the statistical significance of the findings.
- **Data Visualization**: Created pie charts and normal distribution plots to effectively communicate the analysis results and trends in pollutant levels.
